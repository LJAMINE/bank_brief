Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP:

1. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the concept of hiding data within a class and only exposing necessary parts through methods. It protects the internal state of an object by controlling access to its properties.

2. Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to reuse the properties and methods of another class. The class that inherits is called a child class, and the class being inherited is the parent class.

3. Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows methods in different classes to share the same name but behave differently based on the class that implements them.

4. Abstraction

Abstraction focuses on hiding implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
